For example “I want to work on computer vision project with Tensorflow, what stack and image should I use?” Having a trusted well maintained source of images with clean naming convention can help on that.</p>\n<h2>Considered Options</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">s2i-{application}</code> standard name currently, but not everyone knows what S2I is.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">odh-{application}</code> for branding/marketing having ODH in front seems to be the best solution, in this way the name will be shorter as well.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">ps-{application}</code> as it shows what our intention is: we want to provide a curated/predictable software stack, it might be used by ODH or RHODS or others, it might use S2I or other technology. Moreover helps from pipeline creation point of view, because the length of repo name on quay can crate issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These names are for the core repository name, then <code class=\"language-text\">overlays</code> will allow for combinations of libraries based on other criteria, for example <code class=\"language-text\">ml_framework</code> and/or <code class=\"language-text\">hardware</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">`ps-nlp`\n├── overlays                    # Overlays structure for builds\n│   ├── ps-nlp-tensorflow          # NLP image with TensorFlow ML framework\n│   ├── ps-nlp-tensorflow-gpu      # NLP image with TensorFlow ML framework for GPU\n│   ├── ps-nlp-pytorch             # NLP image with Pytorch ML framework\n│   ├── ps-nlp-pytorch-gpu         # NLP image with Pytorch ML framework for GPU\n│   └── ps-nlp-scikit-learn        # NLP image with Scikit-learn ML framework\n└── ...</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Decision Outcome</h2>\n<p>Selected option: <code class=\"language-text\">ps-{application}</code> as it shows what our intention is: we want to provide a curated/predictable software stack, it might be used by ODH or RHODS or others, it might use S2I or other technology.
