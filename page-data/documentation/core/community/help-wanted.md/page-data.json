The <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> label is a subset of the <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code>\nlabel, indicating that members have committed to providing extra assistance for\nnew contributors. All <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> items also have the <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code>\nlabel.</p>\n<p>We also have some <a href=\"#suggestions\">suggestions</a> for using these labels to help\ngrow and improve our community.</p>\n<h2>Help Wanted</h2>\n<p>Items marked with the <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code> label need to ensure that they meet these criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Low Barrier to Entry</strong>\nIt should be easy for new contributors. Documentation on how that type of\nchange should be made should already exist.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clear Task</strong>\nThe task is agreed upon and does not require further discussions in the\ncommunity. Call out if that area of code is untested and requires new\nfixtures.</p>\n<p>API and CLI behavior should be decided and included in the OP issue, for example: ‚ÄúThe\nnew command syntax is <code class=\"language-text\">svcat unbind NAME [--orphan] [--timeout 5m]</code>‚Äù, with\nexpected validations called out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goldilocks priority</strong>\nThe priority should not be so high that a core contributor should do it, but not too low that it\nisn‚Äôt useful enough for a core contributor to spend time reviewing it, answering\nquestions, helping get it into a release, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Up-To-Date</strong>\nOften these issues become obsolete and have already been completed, are no longer\ndesired, no longer make sense, or have changed priority or difficulty.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These commands can be used with GitHub issues to manage the <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code> label:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">/help</code> : Adds the <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code> label to an issue.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">/remove-help</code> : Removes the <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code> label from an issue. If the\n<code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> label is present, it is removed as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Good First Issue</h2>\n<p>Items marked with the <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> label are intended for <em>first-time\ncontributors</em>. It indicates that members will keep an eye out for these pull\nrequests and shepherd it through our processes.</p>\n<p><strong>New contributors should not be left to find an approver, ping for reviews,\ndecipher prow commands, or identify that their build failed due to a flake.</strong>\nIt is important to make new contributors feel welcome and valued. We should assure them that they\nwill have an extra level of help with their first contribution.</p>\n<p>After a contributor has successfully completed one or two <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> items, they\nshould be ready to move on to <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code> items.</p>\n<p>All <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> items need to follow the guidelines for <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code>\nitems in addition to meeting the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No Barrier to Entry</strong>\nThe task is something that a new contributor can tackle without advanced\nsetup or domain knowledge.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Solution Explained</strong>\nThe recommended solution is clearly described in the issue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provides Context</strong>\nIf background knowledge is required, this should be explicitly mentioned and a\nlist of suggested readings included.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gives Examples</strong>\nLink to examples of similar implementations so new contributors have a\nreference guide for their changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Identifies Relevant Code</strong>\nThe relevant code and tests to be changed should be linked in the issue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ready to Test</strong>\nThere should be existing tests that can be modified, or existing test cases\nfit to be copied. If the area of code doesn‚Äôt have tests, before labeling the\nissue, add a test fixture. This prep often makes a great <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code> task!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These commands can be used in the GitHub issue comments to control the <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> label:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">/good-first-issue</code> : Adds the <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> label to an issue. Also adds\nthe <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code> label, if not already present.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">/remove-good-first-issue</code> : Removes the <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> label from an issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Suggestions for Experienced Community Members</h2>\n<p>We encourage our more experienced members to help new contributors, so that the\ncommunity can continue to grow and maintain the kind, inclusive\ncommunity that we all enjoy today.</p>\n<p>The following suggestions go a long way toward preventing ‚Äúdrive-by‚Äù PRs, and\nensure that our investment in new contributors is rewarded by returning contributors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide extra assistance during reviews on <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> pull requests.</li>\n<li>Answer questions and identify useful docs.</li>\n<li>Offer advice such as ‚ÄúOne way to reproduce this in a cluster is to do X and\nthen you can use kubectl to poke around,‚Äù or ‚ÄúDid you know that you can\nuse fake clients to setup and test this easier?‚Äù</li>\n<li>Help new contributors learn enough about the project, setting up their\nenvironment, running tests, and navigating this area of the code so that they\ncan tackle a related <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code> issue next time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you make someone feel like a part of our community, they will know that it is safe to ask\nquestions, that people will let them know the rules, and that their\ncontributions are helpful and appreciated. They will stick around! üåà</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage new contributors to seek help on the appropriate slack channels,\nintroduce them, and include them in your conversations.</li>\n<li>Invite them to the SIG meetings.</li>\n<li>Give credit to new contributors so that others get to know them: ‚ÄúHey, would\nsomeone help give a second LGTM on @newperson‚Äôs first PR on chocolate\nbunnies?‚Äù Mention them in the SIG channel and meeting, and thank them on Twitter or\n#shoutouts.</li>\n<li>Use all the emoji in your approve or lgtm comment. üíñ üöÄ</li>\n<li>Let them know that their <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> is getting extra attention to make\nthe first one easier and help them find a follow-up issue.</li>\n<li>Suggest a related <code class=\"language-text\">help wanted</code> so that can build up experience in an area.</li>\n<li>People are more likely to continue contributing when they know what to expect.\nThey want to know the acceptable way to ask for people to review a PR, and how to nudge things along\nwhen a PR is stalled. Show them how we operate by helping move their first PR\nalong.</li>\n<li>If you have time, let the contributor know that they can DM you with questions\nthat they aren‚Äôt yet comfortable asking the wider group.</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"srcLink":"https://github.com/thoth-station/core/blob/master/community/help-wanted.md"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Help Wanted and Good First Issue Labels","description":"This document provides guidance on how and when to use the help wanted and\ngood first issue labels.
