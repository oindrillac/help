See repository guidelines, below.</li>\n<li>Welcoming and respectful: See Code of Conduct, below.</li>\n<li>Transparent and accessible: Work and collaboration should be done in public. See SIG governance, below.</li>\n<li>Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, [scope], and [design principles].</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>\n<p>The Thoth Station community abides by [out code of conduct]:</p>\n<p><em>As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.</em></p>\n<p>As a member of the project, you represent the project and your fellow contributors.\nWe value our community tremendously and we’d like to keep cultivating a friendly and collaborative\nenvironment for our contributors and users. We want everyone in the community to have\n[positive experiences].</p>\n<h1>Community groups</h1>\n<p>The project is comprised of the following types of subgroups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Special Interest Groups, SIGs\n<ul>\n<li>Subprojects</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>SIGs</h2>\n<p>The project is organized primarily into Special Interest\nGroups, or SIGs. Each SIG is comprised of members from multiple\ncompanies and organizations, with a common purpose of advancing the\nproject with respect to a specific topic, such as Observability or\nDocumentation. Our goal is to enable a distributed decision structure\nand code ownership, as well as providing focused forums for getting\nwork done, making decisions, and onboarding new contributors. Every\nidentifiable subpart of the project (e.g., github org, repository,\nsubdirectory, API, test, issue, PR) is intended to be owned by some\nSIG.</p>\n<p>SIGs must have at least one and ideally two SIG chairs at any given\ntime. SIG chairs are intended to be organizers and facilitators,\nresponsible for the operation of the SIG and for communication and\ncoordination with the other SIGs, the Steering Committee, and the\nbroader community.</p>\n<p>Each SIG must have a charter that specifies its scope (topics,\nsubsystems, code repos and directories), responsibilities, areas of\nauthority, how members and roles of authority/leadership are\nselected/granted, how decisions are made, and how conflicts are\nresolved.</p>\n<p>A primary reason that SIGs exist is as forums for collaboration.\nMuch work in a SIG should stay local within that SIG. However, SIGs\nmust communicate in the open, ensure other SIGs and community members\ncan find notes of meetings, discussions, designs, and decisions, and\nperiodically communicate a high-level summary of the SIG’s work to the\ncommunity.</p>\n<h3>Subprojects</h3>\n<p>Specific work efforts within SIGs are divided into <strong>subprojects</strong>.\nEvery part of the code, data and documentation must be owned by\nsome subproject. Some SIGs may have a single subproject, but many SIGs\nhave multiple significant subprojects with distinct (though sometimes\noverlapping) sets of contributors and [owners], who act as\nsubproject’s technical leaders.</p>\n<p>Subprojects for each SIG are documented in [sigs.yaml].</p>","fields":{"srcLink":"https://github.com/thoth-station/core/blob/master/community/governance.md"},"frontmatter":{"title":"","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"33804a79-49b4-5af1-bb4d-cad3358a0ec5","previousPostId":"a3a7d5d1-14b4-5335-8072-f45e2c24137e","nextPostId":"0079be69-27d9-5603-b463-c99ef91ac5bd"}},
